## Clinical Trial Data Analysis Report

This report summarizes the process and key findings from the analysis of the clinical trial data for two diabetes treatments, Auralin and Novodra.

### 1\. Data Loading and Initial Inspection

The analysis began by loading three datasets: `patients.csv`, `treatments.csv`, and `adverse_reactions.csv` into pandas DataFrames. Initial inspection included checking for missing values, duplicate entries, and inconsistencies in the data.

### 2\. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

Several data cleaning steps were performed to ensure data quality and prepare the datasets for analysis:

*   **Handling Missing Values:**
    *   Missing address-related information (address, city, state, zip\_code, country, contact) in the `patients` dataframe was filled with "Unknown".
    *   Missing `hba1c_change` values in the `treatments` dataframe were calculated by subtracting `hba1c_end` from `hba1c_start`.
*   **Removing Duplicates:** Duplicate entries in the `patients` and `treatments` dataframes, identified based on 'given\_name' and 'surname', were removed, keeping the first occurrence.
*   **Handling Inconsistencies and Standardizing Data:**
    *   The 'contact' column in the `patients` dataframe was normalized by extracting phone numbers and email addresses into separate columns (`phone_number` and `email`), and the original 'contact' column was dropped.
    *   State abbreviations in the 'state' column of the `patients` dataframe were standardized to full state names.
    *   Invalid dosage entries ('-') in the 'auralin' and 'novodra' columns of the `treatments` dataframe were replaced with `None`.
    *   The 'auralin' and 'novodra' dosage strings were converted to numerical values (averaging ranges) and stored in new columns (`auralin_dose` and `novodra_dose`).
*   **Handling Outliers:** Clinically implausible outliers in patient height and weight in the `patients` dataframe were identified and removed.

### 3\. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Exploratory analysis was conducted to understand the characteristics of the patient population and the distributions of key variables:

*   **Patient Demographics:**
    *   The distribution of patient age at the time of the trial was analyzed and visualized (histogram).
    *   The distribution of participants by sex was analyzed and visualized (countplot), showing a balanced distribution.
    *   The distribution of patient BMI was analyzed and visualized (histogram).
*   **Baseline Characteristics:**
    *   Descriptive statistics and visualizations (box plots) were used to analyze and compare baseline HbA1c (`hba1c_start`) between the Auralin and Novodra treatment groups. Statistical testing (Welch's t-test and SMD) confirmed that the groups were well-balanced at baseline in terms of HbA1c.

### 4\. Analysis of Treatment Outcomes

The effectiveness and safety of the treatments were assessed:

*   **HbA1c Change:**
    *   The change in HbA1c (`hba1c_change`) from start to end of treatment was calculated.
    *   Descriptive statistics and visualizations (box plots) were used to compare the distribution of HbA1c change between the Auralin and Novodra groups.
    *   Statistical testing (independent samples t-tests, including Welch's t-test) revealed a highly statistically significant difference in mean HbA1c change between the two groups, with Novodra showing a greater reduction in HbA1c. Cohen's d indicated a large effect size.
*   **Dose-Response Relationship (Auralin):** The correlation between Auralin dose and HbA1c change was assessed through visualization (scatter plot) and statistical testing (Pearson correlation). No statistically significant linear correlation was found, suggesting no clear dose-response relationship for Auralin within the tested range.
*   **Adverse Reactions:**
    *   The incidence of adverse reactions was calculated for each treatment group.
    *   The frequency of each type of adverse reaction was determined for each group.
    *   A Chi-squared test was performed to compare the overall incidence of adverse reactions between the groups. The test showed no statistically significant difference in the overall adverse reaction rates between Auralin and Novodra, suggesting comparable safety profiles in terms of overall incidence. Hypoglycemia was the most common reaction in both groups.

### 5\. Summary and Conclusion

Based on the analysis:

*   **Effectiveness:** Novodra demonstrated significantly greater effectiveness in reducing HbA1c levels compared to Auralin in this trial. There was no clear dose-response relationship observed for Auralin.
*   **Safety:** Auralin appears to have a comparable safety profile to Novodra in terms of the overall incidence and types of adverse reactions observed in this trial.
*   **Recommendation for Large-Scale Production:** While Auralin appears safe, its lower effectiveness in reducing HbA1c compared to Novodra suggests that proceeding to large-scale production might be challenging without further evidence of other benefits or a specific target patient population. Further trials (e.g., Phase 3) would be necessary to confirm these findings in a larger and more diverse population and evaluate long-term outcomes and cost-effectiveness.

This analysis provides valuable insights into the performance of Auralin and Novodra in this clinical trial, highlighting Novodra's superior efficacy in reducing HbA1c while both treatments showed similar overall safety profiles in this dataset.
